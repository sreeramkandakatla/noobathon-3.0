     </center>
         <p>A cinnamon roll is a sweet baked dough filled with a cinnamon-sugar filling. Made with a rich dough leavened with yeast, their characteristic form is due to rolling a dough sheet containing sweetened cinnamon filling. Common toppings for cinnamon rolls include cream cheese frosting or a sugar glaze.</p>

         <h3>FIRE</h3>
         <p>Fire Pokémon have notably fewer species compared to the other Starter types, due to a lack of natural phenomena that can be described as fire - the Slugma line, Numel line, Magmar line, Torkoal, and Volcanion are the closest representation.</p>

         <p>Fire-type moves are based on attacks of fire itself, and most of them can leave the status Burn. Fire types are also immune to being Burned, regardless of the type of move used that would have inflicted a Burn.</p>

         <h3>WATER</h3>
         <p>There are more Pokémon of this type than any other type due to the large number of marine creatures to base species from. Most Pokémon of this type also have another type, representing the biodiversity of marine creatures.</p>

         <p>Most Water-type Pokémon are based on creatures that live on water, or use water for their disposition. Their attacks involve use of water, if not, attacks that can be done only by marine creatures.</p>

         <h3>GRASS</h3>
         <p>Many Grass types are based on plants and fungi, not necessarily grass (Pokémon such as Cacturne, which is a cactus, and Foongus, which is a mushroom). Many Grass-type Pokémon also belong to the Plant Egg Group.</p>

         <h3>PSYCHIC</h3>
         <p>Many Pokémon are of this type, and, being the type with most Legendary Pokémon, for many, the Psychic-type is the most powerful. Psychic-type Pokémon tend to be very intelligent. It's also interesting to note that, many Psychic-type Pokémon are based/related to real scientific or mythological discoveries such as DNA and Psychokinesis.</p>

         <h3>ROCK</h3>
         <p>Rock-type Pokémon stand out for their great defense to physical attacks; however, this type is tied with the Grass type as having the most weaknesses, with five, and Pokémon of this type are not very fast.</p>

         <p> Their fossils preserve enough material genetic to be worked with to bring them back to life, but it can be known, that the Rock type was very abundant. They also have unique combinations to Pokémon of the present.</p>

         <h3>DRAGON</h3>
         <p>The Dragon-type is often considered an ancestral type as many Legendary Dragon-type Pokémon are revered as deities. Other Dragon-type Pokémon are frequently hard to catch and train. They also evolve late and are relatively rare. An interesting fact is that the stats of many Dragon-type Pokémon surpass the stats of other types of Pokémon.</p>

      </center>

         <p>Most Pokémon with the Dragon-type are usually reptilian in appearance, with a few exceptions being Charizard (who is Fire/Flying by default, but can become part Dragon-type if exposed to a Charizardite X Mega Stone).</p>

         <h3>FLYING</h3>
         <p>Pokémon of this type can fly, many of them live at high altitudes, even. Most of them are based on birds and insects. Their power is mostly related with aerial and wind-related moves. Most of them have wings, but there are also some of them that just float without wings, like Rayquaza and Gyarados.</p>
